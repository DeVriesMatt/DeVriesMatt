I am a PhD student at the [Insitute of Cancer Research](https://www.icr.ac.uk/) and [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) researching Deep Learning in Cancer Biology under the supervision of [Chris Bakal](https://www.icr.ac.uk/our-research/researchers-and-teams/professor-chris-bakal) and [Chris Dunsby](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/christopher.dunsby). My PhD is part of the CRUK [Accelerator](https://mach3cancer.org/) award. I have an undergraduate degree in Statistics from the [University of Cape Town](https://www.uct.ac.za/) and a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/).

My current work focuses on developing computer vision techniques to understand live 3D cancer biology. My research interests are in Geometric Deep Learning, 3D Computer Vision, Shape Analysis and Explainable AI. 

Please see my organisations - [Sentinal4D](https://github.com/Sentinal4D) and [MagniViT](https://github.com/MagniViT) - for collaborations on geometric deep learning in cancer biology, and vision transformers for classification of soft tissue sarcoma from whole slide images.

Aside from my work and research, I am an avid runner, swimmer, cyclist, and footballer.
